## 🧠 Abstract

Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) is a serious medical condition requiring urgent diagnosis. This project presents an automated solution using a custom **Convolutional Neural Network with Attention mechanism** to detect ICH from brain MRI images. The model is deployed using Streamlit to enable quick access and seamless clinical decision support.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📤 Upload MRI scans in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
- 🧠 AI model classifies images as **ICH** or **No ICH**.
- 📊 Displays **model confidence score**.
- 🧼 Clean and interactive UI with **sidebar info**.
- ⚡ Real-time inference using `.h5` deep learning model.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- Publicly available brain MRI scan datasets were used.
- Images were resized to `128x128x3`.
- Labels: **ICH** and **No ICH**
- Data augmentation and preprocessing were applied for better generalization.
